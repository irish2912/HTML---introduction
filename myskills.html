    <h2>Group work</h2>
    <p>Many classes assign group projects or other activities <br>
        where you have to collaborate with other students. Learning how to work <br>
         productively in a group can improve your communication, leadership and conflict resolution skills. <br>
         In your career, you may work on projects that involve a team or other departments.</p>
    <h2>Multitasking</h2>
    <p>Multitasking is the ability to work on several projects at once. <br>
        In an academic setting, you can use these skills to complete assignments for all of your classes. <br>
        In the workplace, you may have multiple responsibilities and tasks. <br>
        Improving your ability to prioritize, organize and perform these tasks can increase your chances of success.</p>
    <h2>Adaptability</h2>
   <p>Adaptability is the ability to accept changes. This skill can help students gain confidence and become <br>
    more flexible when faced with change. Developing this skill could prepare them for their careers and lives after school.<br>
     Students can grow these skills by completing projects and activities based on real-life problems.</p>
     <h2>Curiosity</h2>
     <p>Curiosity is a personality trait that students can develop over time. Curiosity is the desire to know more about something, <br>
    and it's an important skill for all students. Curious students often ask more questions and learn more on their own. <br>
    For example, a curious student might complete additional research outside of school to learn more about a topic. </p>
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Collaboration is when two or more people work together to reach a common goal. <br>
    Students use collaboration to complete group projects and shared tasks. <br>
    They can develop these skills in the classroom and during extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs.</p>
